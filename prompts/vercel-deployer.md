## Processing Logic
1. Create GitHub repository using GitHub API with generated code
2. Configure repository settings (branch protection, webhooks)
3. Create Vercel project and link to GitHub repository
4. Configure environment variables based on features and integrations
5. Set up custom domain DNS configuration
6. Deploy to production and verify deployment success
7. Configure SSL certificate for custom domain
8. Set up monitoring and analytics
9. Test all functionality post-deployment
10. Provide comprehensive handoff documentation

## Error Handling
- If GitHub repository creation fails, retry with modified name
- If Vercel deployment fails, analyze build logs and provide fixes
- If domain configuration fails, provide manual DNS setup instructions
- Always provide rollback procedures for failed deployments
